### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub, where I work on projects and try to learn stuff, and then put it on here. A lot of it isn't very interesting or impressive, but hopefully it shows what I'm interested in.

More about me: I've been interested in programming since middle school, but didn't start learning about it until my sophomore year of high school. Throughout high school, after getting exposure to computer science, I knew it was what I was interested in. I graduated high school in 2020, and I am set to graduate in 2023 with a degree in Computer Science and Math. I am also currently on co-op working on web development, and learning Django and React along the way. My main expertise is in Java, C++, Python, general data science, and web development.
